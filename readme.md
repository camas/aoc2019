My solutions for <https://adventofcode.com/2019/>

## Info

Files for each solution are in their respectively numbered folder

Question markdown is generated using [a userscript](https://gist.github.com/camas/99a447e432eabbb2a88968bbad8b0cc7)

Use `solve.py` to run solutions. VSCode launch configs are also provided

For each solution `solve.py` calls `solve(data: str)` to run inputs and `tests() -> List[Tuple[str, str]]` to get test data

Tests (and the `tests()` function) are optional

If a single solution is run the answer is copied to clipboard

## Examples

Show help: `python solve.py -h`

Run solution 1: `python solve.py 1`

Run solutions 1, 2 and 3: `python solve.py 1 2 3`
